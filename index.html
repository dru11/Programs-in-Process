      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mym9iKCHP4c">Man in the Mirror - Patrick Morley - Identity</a>
      No man falls on purpose (but do we oppose ourselves)
      We're looking for a win - we want to be the hero of our own story
      Who am I? What is my life about?
      One way to talk about identity is 'that which distinguishes your every
      from every other person on the planet'
      Is there desire for commonality
      Interesting that Christ was attacked from a question of His identity
        40 and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself!
        If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross." Matt. 27:40

        Matthew 4:3,5-6
        3 And the tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.”
        5 Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, 6 and said to him,
        “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written,..."
 Identity - that which makes you known to others

 Your identity is a 'sort of fingerprint of your soul'

      I find this interestin as it does not yet appear what we shall be...

      You don't know who that person is because
        1. Everyone is trying to present the best version of themselves
        2. There is a war going on inside of each of us
          - flesh and spirit are in conflict

    1 Samuel 16:7 The Lord sees us differently

    "Who we are where only God can see us is who we really are "

    <ol>
      <h3>"The 4 ways men pusue who they are and what their lives ar about"</h3>
      <li>Secular: Max pleasure, min. pain</li>
      <li>Moral: Do right. Do no harm.</li>
      <li>Religious:Perform to please God.</li>
      <li>Christianity:Love God and love people.</li>
    </ol>

The original temptation struck at identity and God's original purpose was an identity
