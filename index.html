    <ul>
    <li>No man falls on purpose (but do we oppose ourselves)</li>
    <li>We're looking for a win - we want to be the hero of our own story</li>
    <li>Who am I? What is my life about?</li>
    <li>One way to talk about identity is 'that which distinguishes your every
    from every other person on the planet'</li>
  </ul>
<pre>

  <p>

    Identity - that which makes you known to others
    Your identity is a 'sort of fingerprint of your soul'

    You don't know who that person is because
      1. Everyone is trying to present the best version of themselves
      2. There is a war going on inside of each of us
        - flesh and spirit are in conflict

    1 Samuel 16:7 The Lord sees us differently
    "Who we are where only God can see us is who we really are "</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center";><b><u>THOUGHTS</u></b></h2>

      Is there desire for commonality/unity
      Interesting that Christ was attacked from a question of His identity

      <b>Matt. 27:40</b>
      and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself!
      If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."

      <b>Matthew 4:3,5-6</b>
      3 And the tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.”
      5 Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, 6 and said to him,
      “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written,..."
    The original temptation struck at identity and God's original purpose was an identity
